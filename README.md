# Meddit: *A Safe Space With No Trace*

Meddit is a website application that addresses the 3rd highest cause of fatalities in the United States: **Medical Errors**. The platform creates exclusive and anonymous spaces for participating hospitals' healthcare officials to particpiate in the exchange of information and advice. Every time a user logs into their account, they will see a list of posts of various topics from other anonymous medical workers and have the option to view, like, and/or respond to a post. Each user also has the option to create their own post entailing the subject they wish to post about. Through these features of Meddit, our hope is that users will realize that several other medical workers across the world also make medical errors and gain motivation to report any medical errors that they have made to prevent the same ones from occuring frequently in the future.
