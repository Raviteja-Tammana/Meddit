Examples of these medical errors include equipment failure, improper transfusions, inaccurate medication recommendations, and misdiagnoses; as human beings, we present our bodies and our lives to hospitals and medical workers without a second thought, but evidently, the mistakes they make are a large reason why many people lose them. But medical workers are human beings too, so rather than blaming them, why not come up with a way to help them?'

        content: 'Introducing Meddit: a collaborative platform designed exclusively for every hospital\'s medical community! Many of the medical errors made today are due to human emotions, including stress and confusion. And many times, because of their fear and/or ego, medical workers hesitate to reach out for assistance even when they\'re not confident in their decisions. THAT is the issue Meddit hopes to tackle; by fostering a discussion forum for each hospital\'s medical workers, Meddit creates a comfortable, safe, and dynamic space for medical workers to anonymously share insights, seek advice, and confirm their conclusions without the fear of judgement or decidophobia. Through this wonderful exchange of knowledge, medical workers can also gain awareness to common mistakes and errors and learn not to perform them themselves, leading to an overall decrease in medical errors and therefore decrease in the number of deaths of human beings.'
